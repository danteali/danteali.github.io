# Dante's Docs

**Currently testing the capability/configuration of GitHub Pages and MkDocs**
**Along with ironing out some of the differences in markdown syntax between Obsidian and Github**

<br>

**Only uploaded a sample of files for the moment. Hopefully you'll still find the useful while I continue playing with the site configuration.**

<br>

This site is mainly a repository of my own notes which I've compiled over the last few years. The general purpose of the notes is to help me remember things. And this site helps as a backup to my local storage (not the only backup!).

The notes also form something of a 'living document' which get updated as a learn more about a topic.

Hopefully some of these will be crawled by Google and will help other solve issues that I've come acorss, or provide a shortcut to some of the things I had to spend a lot of time reaserching.

Good Luck.
